# NED Migration Utility

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

The NMU(NED Migration Utility) is tool that demystifies the NED migration process, and makes it safe for NSO operators to run NED migrations on a list of devices in a batch fashion. Thus gaining operationnal time while avoiding side effects.

NED migrations usually need to be ran over a number of devices that needs to be migrated, and every device has its own conditions and states that  may affect the services that are configured on it.

The NMU gives the possibility to the users to run migrations in a safe manner, it can migrate devices that do not have special conditions automatically, and gives the user the possibility to deal seperatly with caveats.
The NMU generates reports that contain all the affected services, device state, migrated paths and much more.

    usage: ./ned_migration.py [-h] [--dry-run] [--no-networking] --new-ned-id
                            NEW_NED_ID --file FILE

    Ned Migration utility to facilitate the  ned migration process for multiple devices in one go.

    This is a utility that takes as an input a list of devices and a ned-id to migrate to and executes the following:
    1 - Reads devices list file and loops over the device list
    2 - Checks if the device is onboarded
    3 - Checks if the NED is loaded
    4 - Checks if the device is already migrated
    5 - Executes ned migration in a dry-run mode
    6 - Shows the modified paths and their info
    7 - Shows the affected services if there are any
    8 - Gives the user the following options if there are affected services:
        a - Execute the ned migration
        b - Skipping the current device ned migration
        c - Exiting the whole program
    9 - If there are no affected services or the user choses option 'a'. Ned migration action is executed.
    10 - The script continues to the next device
    11 - This utility generates two sets of files :
        a - NED migration log file : ned-migration-devices.log
        b - NED migration JSON report : migration-datetime.json
    
    There are options that the user can chose to run the ned migration over the device list:
    1 {--dry-run}: The utility only simulates the ned migration and shows the modified paths 
                    and affected services
    2 {--no-networking}: The utility runs the ned migration action in no-networking mode.
                    i.e  the action uses the device configuration in CDB and doesn't connect 
                    and read the configuration from the device
    3 {--verbose} : The utility uses this option by default to show the affected services and
                    doesn't give the user the possibility to activate/deactivate this option
                    to avoid running ned migrations without checking the affected services
                    
    Other arguments:
    {--new-ned-id} : the target ned id of the ned migration
    {--file} : devices list file where the devices are newline-delimited:
    device1
    device2
    ...
    deviceN

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --dry-run, -d         Perform the Ned Migration using dry-run option to only simulate the output of the operation.
      --no-networking       Perform the Ned Migration using the no-networking option to use the device configuration in CDB.
      --new-ned-id NEW_NED_ID
                            Perform the Ned Migration using the new-ned-id provided in the input
      --file FILE, -f FILE  Path of the file containing the list of devices to perform NED migration on.
                                                The devices are newline-delimited
